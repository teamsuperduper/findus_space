## Running
FindUs.Space is no longer hosted (we used a 1-year domain givn out by GovHack), but you can run it on your own computer if you have [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). You'll need the [`tidyverse`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse), [`shiny`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny) and [`leaflet`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=leaflet) packages (heads up: `tidyverse` takes a while to install!). Then:

    shiny::runGitHub('findus_space', 'teamsuperduper')
